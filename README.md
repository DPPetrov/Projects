## 1.1 What is the program about?

### "Coffee Machine" is created in Java using InteliJ 2022 and its purpose is to show understanding 
### of basic and fundamental concepts of the language - variables, conditional statements, loops, switch-cases, global variables,
### global classes, exception handling.
### The program is based on my own epxperience and understanding of methods and classes.

## 1.2 How does it work?

 @ When the program loads, the user is prompted to make a choice between
three bevarages - Espresso, Cappuccino and Latte.

 @ The program displays the available ingredients (hardcoded values) for every bevarage.

 @ All choices are set with a hotkey (the first letter from each bevarage - (E)spresso
(C)appucchino, (L)atte), as to minimize the required input from the user.

 @ After the choice has been made, the user inputs the requested amount and if it is enough, the process begins, or they are prompted to insert a sufficient amount, 
 in order to continue. Once the process is finished, the remaining ingredients and change (if any) are displayed, and the user can either "Stop" the process, or 
 continue until the machine is out of ingredients, at which point the program will display a message and shut down on its own.
 
 # How to run the program
 II. As sometimes the "Fundamentals.exe" does not execute, I have created a Run.bat file that will start the program instead. Simply run the "Run" file in order to begin.
